# Benchmark Suite

## `BinaryBenchmarkSuite`  (preview ⚠️)
A `BinaryBenchmarkSuite` is a suite of programs which can be used to run binary
benchmarks such as for C/C++ benchmarking.

### Keys
`programs`: A yaml list of benchmarks in the format:
```yaml
programs:
  <BM_NAME_1>:
    path: /full/path/to/benchmark/binary_1
    args: "Any arguments to binary_1"
  <BM_NAME_2>:
    path: /full/path/to/benchmark/binary_2
    args: "Any arguments to binary_2"
  [...]
```

A possible use-case could use wrapper shell scripts around the benchmark to
output timing and other information in a tab-separated table.

## `DaCapo`
[DaCapo benchmark suite](https://www.dacapobench.org/).
### Keys
`release`: one of the possible values `["2006", "9.12", "evaluation"]`.
The value is required.

`path`: path to the DaCapo `jar`.
The value is required.

`minheap`: a string that selects one of the `minheap_values` sets to use.

`minheap_values`: a dictionary containing multiple named sets of minimal heap sizes that is enough for a benchmark from the suite to run without triggering `OutOfMemoryError`.
Each size is measured in MiB.
The default value is an empty dictionary.
The minheap values are used only when running `runbms` with a valid `N` value.
If the minheap value for a benchmark is not specified, a default of `4096` is used.
An example looks like this.
```yaml
minheap_values:
  adoptopenjdk-15-G1:
    avrora: 7
    batik: 253
  temurin-17-G1:
    avrora: 7
    batik: 189
```

`timing_iteration`: specifying the timing iteration.
It can either be a number, which is passed to DaCapo as `-n`, or a string `converge`.
The default value is 3.

`callback`: the class (possibly within some packages) for the DaCapo callback. The value is passed to DaCapo as `-c`.
The default value is `null`.

`timeout`: timeout for one invocation of a benchmark in seconds.
The default value is `null`.

`wrapper` (preview ⚠️): specifying a wrapper (i.e., extra stuff on the command line before `java`) when running benchmarks.
The default value is `null`, a no-op.
There are two possible ways to specify `wrapper`.
First, a single string with [shell-like syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.split).
Multiple arguments are space separated.
This wrapper is used for all benchmarks in the benchmark suite.
Second, a dictionary of strings with shell-like syntax to specify possibly different wrappers for different benchmarks.
If a benchmark doesn't have a wrapper in the dictionary, it is treated as `null`.

`companion` (preview ⚠️): the syntax is similar to `wrapper`.
The companion program will start before the main program.
The main program will start two seconds after the companion program to make sure the companion is fully initialized.
Once the main program finishes, we will wait for the companion program to finish.
Therefore, companion programs should have appropriate timeouts or detect when main program finishes.
Here is an example of using `companion` to launch `bpftrace` in the background to count the system calls.
```yaml
includes:
  - "$RUNNING_NG_PACKAGE_DATA/base/runbms.yml"

overrides:
  "suites.dacapo2006.timing_iteration": 1
  "suites.dacapo2006.companion": "sudo bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @syscall[args->id] = count(); @process[comm] = count();} interval:s:10 { printf(\"Goodbye world!\\n\"); exit(); }'"
  "invocations": 1

benchmarks:
  dacapo2006:
    - fop

configs:
  - "temurin-17"
```
In the log file, the output from the main program and the output from the companion program is separated by `*****`.

`size`: specifying the size of input data.
Note that the names of the sizes are subject to change depending on the DaCapo releases.
The default value is `null`, which means DaCapo will use the default size unless you override that for individual benchmarks.

### Benchmark Specification
Some of the suite-wide keys can be overridden in a per-benchmark-basis.
The keys currently supported are `timing_iteration`, `size`, and `timeout`.
Note that, within a suite, your choice of `name` should uniquely identify a particular way of running a benchmark of name `bm_name`.
The `name` is used to get the minheap value, etc., which can depend of the size of input data and/or the timing iteration.
Therefore, it is highly recommended that you give a `name` different from the `bm_name`.

Note that, you might need to adjust various other values, including but not limit to the minheap value dictionary and the modifier exclusion dictionary.

The following is an example.
```yaml
benchmarks:
  dacapo2006:
    - {name: eclipse_large, bm_name: eclipse, size: large}
```

## `SPECjbb2015` (preview ⚠️)
[SPECjbb2015](https://www.spec.org/jbb2015/).

### Keys
`release`: one of the possible values `["1.03"]`.
The value is required.

`path`: path to the `jar`.
The value is required.
Note that the property file should reside in `path/../config/specjbb2015.props` per the standard folder structure of the ISO image provided by SPEC.

### Benchmark Specification
Only strings are allowed, which should correspond to the the mode of the SPECjbb2015 controller.
Right now, only `"composite"` is supported.

## `SPECjvm98` (preview ⚠️)
[SPECjvm98](https://www.spec.org/jvm98/).

Note that you will need to prepend probes to the classpaths, so that the [modified](https://github.com/anupli/probes/blob/master/SpecApplication.java) `SpecApplication` can be used.

Here is an example configuration file.
```yaml
includes:
  - "/home/zixianc/running-ng/src/running/config/base/runbms.yml"

modifiers:
  probes_cp:
    type: JVMClasspathPrepend
    val: "/home/zixianc/MMTk-Dev/evaluation/probes /home/zixianc/MMTk-Dev/evaluation/probes/probes.jar"

benchmarks:
  specjvm98:
    - _213_javac

configs:
  - "adoptopenjdk-8|probes_cp"
```

### Keys
`release`: one of the possible values `["1.03_05"]`.
The value is required.

`path`: path to the SPECjvm98 folder, where you can find `SpecApplication.class`.
The value is required.

`timing_iteration`: specifying the timing iteration.
It can only be a number, which is passed to SpecApplication as `-i`.
The value is required.

### Benchmark Specification
Only strings are allowed, which should correspond to benchmark program of SPECjvm98.
The following are the benchmarks:
- _200_check
- _201_compress
- _202_jess
- _209_db
- _213_javac
- _222_mpegaudio
- _227_mtrt
- _228_jack

## `Octane` (preview ⚠️)
### Keys
`path`: path to the Octane benchmark folder.
The value is required.

`wrapper`: path to the Octane wrapper written by Wenyu Zhao.
The value is required.

`timing_iteration`: specifying the timing iteration using an integer.
The value is required.

`minheap`: a string that selects one of the `minheap_values` sets to use.

`minheap_values`: a dictionary containing multiple named sets of minimal heap sizes that is enough for a benchmark from the suite to run without triggering `Fatal javascript OOM in ...`.
Each size is measured in MiB.
The default value is an empty dictionary.
The minheap values are used only when running `runbms` with a valid `N` value.
If the minheap value for a benchmark is not specified, a default of `4096` is used.
An example looks like this.
```yaml
minheap_values:
  d8:
    octane:
      box2d: 5
      codeload: 159
      crypto: 3
```
